My name is Sascha Schimke. My profession is software developer and software architect.
Before I worked as computer scientist at a German university to get my PhD.

In 2013 I became an _OMG Certified UML Professional_ (OCUP2-F) and
since 2014, I am a _Certified Professional for Software Architecture_ (CPSA-F).
